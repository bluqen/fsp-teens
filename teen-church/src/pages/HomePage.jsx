              At FSP Teens, our mission is to raise a generation of teenagers who know God personally, love Him passionately, and live for Him intentionally. As a vibrant arm of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), we are committed to helping young people grow in their relationship with Christ through worship, prayer, the Word, and fellowship. We believe every teen carries divine potential, and through discipleship, mentorship, and service, we guide them to discover their God-given purpose and walk boldly in it.
              We strive to build a community where faith is alive, love is genuine, and holiness is our lifestyle. Our goal is to empower teens to stand firm in truth, lead with integrity, and influence their world for Jesusâ€”whether in their schools, homes, or online spaces. At FSP Teens, weâ€™re not just preparing for the future; we are shaping it through a generation of believers passionate about God and committed to transforming their world for His glory.At FSP Teens, our mission is to raise a generation of teenagers who know God personally, love Him passionately, and live for Him intentionally.
